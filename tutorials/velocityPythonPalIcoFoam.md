# My second tutorial: Embedding a Keras-based neural network in OpenFOAM with pythonPalIcoFoam

This is a videotutorial, where we demonstrate how to use pythonPal to embed a Keras-based neural network (NN) in OpenFOAM.

This is an easy example where we want the NN to be fed with the components of a vector, and we want it to calculate the magnitude of that vector.

Then, we will use the NN in OpenFOAM. It will be fed with the velocity vector and it will predict the velocity magnitude field, which will be written at every iteration.

We called this application velocityPythonPalIcoFoam. Find the link to the video, [here](https://tinyurl.com/EmbeddingNNWithPythonPal)
